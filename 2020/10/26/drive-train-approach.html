<h2 id="what-is-the-drivetrain-approach-">What is the Drivetrain approach ?</h2>

<p>It is basicly a process to design data products, to ensure that your modeling work is useful in practise. It was introduced in 2012 by Jeremy, along with Margit Zwemer and Mike Loukides.
You can find out more about it here: <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/drivetrain-approach-data-products/">Designing good data products</a></p>

<p>Well, now that we saw what it was usefull for, and where it came from, let’s see the four steps that compose it <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

  <li>We need to define the objective (the end goal)</li>
  <li>Next we need to identify the levers (what can we control)</li>
  <li>After that collect relevent data</li>
  <li>Finally train our model</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>No good explanation is made without a concrete example, so let’s do that.</p>

<p>As a graduate student i will be attending classes, with other students, but as of today we are living in the COVID-19 crysis. And i don’t want to catch it.</p>

<p>Let’s say i’am a director of the computer science department. And i want to minimize the spread of COVID-19 across students of my department (this is the objective).</p>

<p>One of the things i can controll, is to make sure everyone is wearing a face mask, by installing for example cameras across the department entries that would detect if you are wearing a mask or not and would let you or not enter by say opening the door or locking it (this is the lever).</p>

<p>Now to make such a system, i’ll need to train a model for image recognition, so i’ll collect data which will consist of people wearing masks and others not (that’s the data phase).</p>

<p>Finally come the ‘fun’ part where you actually train your model and get to see it in action.</p>
